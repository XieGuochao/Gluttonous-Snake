# Gluttonous Snake in Python

- Language: Python 3
- Author: Guochao XIE


This project adopts the following skills:

1. Functions
2. Multi-Threading Programming
3. Keyboard binding
4. Terminal GUI

To run it, `python3 GluttonousSnake.py`.

For the curses version, you need to install the curses library: Windows: `pip3 install windows-curses`; Mac / Linux: `pip3 install curses`.

To adopt a fancier GUI, one only need to change the `draw()` function!

Hope you can learn something from it!
